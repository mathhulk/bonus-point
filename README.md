Bonus Point can be installed on Windows and macOS in order for teachers or other school administrators to track bonus points for their classes and students through a sleek and minimal user interface.

### Description
Bonus Point can be installed on Windows and macOS in order for teachers or other school administrators to track bonus points for their classes and students through a sleek and minimal user interface. The desktop application was created using [Electron](https://electronjs.org) and makes use of [electron-builder](https://www.electron.build/auto-update) for automatic update distribution and installation. New releases of the desktop application are published automatically when built.

Examples of the user interface can be found [here](https://share.mathhulk.me/2018-09-24_15-21-39.png) or [here](https://github.com/mathhulk/bonus-point/wiki).
